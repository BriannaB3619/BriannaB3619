# About me !

Hello! My name is Brianna and I am a student at the PolyTechnic School of Graphic Information Technology at Arizon State University Online. I want to learn Web Authoring as well as dabble in a bit of design and videography. I hope I can acheive  a wonderful job coding and maintaining sites for companies. Coding is pretty fun to me, once I understand what I'm supposed to be doing, it all makes sense what tags and attributes i need to put where!  Coding makes me feel like i can do something cool and make something from scratch using my knowledge, because being able to do something all on your own is a wonderful feeling! I'm a fun-loving person and somewhat introverted, but once I get to know you, I'm pretty open and friendly
